A Flutter project I following Youtuber talk about developing Flutter app with #Fireabse integrated.

## Getting Started

The course is from `freeCodeodeCamp` and here's [the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8)

## Why am I learn Flutter

Android app has development already been my career skill for about 10 years. Even things get changed a lot since it began, but I got **BORED!**

Trying something new is always the best way to enjoy the process and get excited. And since I bought a new motorcycle which is not always easy to find a parking lot, I decide to create an app just for that purpose.

After this course, I expect to start working on that side project!

Stay tuned!
